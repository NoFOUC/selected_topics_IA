Welcome to the TPs of "Selected Topics in AI".

We will be using Python as well as a range of packages and datasets.

** Local setup on your laptop

To make sure you have an up-to-date Python setup, and avoid Python and packages version conflits, it is highly reommended to make use of the conda package manager and environment system, and install a complete setup such as Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html - contains a decennt set of useful packages), or even Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/ - needs more time and disk space to install but contains a huge set of packages that you will not need to install later).

# 1. Create an environment with dependencies specified in env.yml:
    
    conda env create -f local_env_3.8.yml

# 2. Activate the new environment:
    
    conda activate local_nmt_3.8
    
# 3. Use your favorite development environement
